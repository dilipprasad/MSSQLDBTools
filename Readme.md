### ðŸ“Š **SQL Server Index Columns Explained**

| Column Name                  | Description                                                                    | Good / Acceptable Values                                                           | What to Watch Out For                                    |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **runtime**                  | Timestamp when the data was captured.                                          | Recent timestamps indicate fresh stats.                                            | Old timestamps suggest the data might be outdated.       |
| **index\_group\_handle**     | Internal identifier for a group of related missing index recommendations.      | N/A (used internally).                                                             | No specific threshold â€” used for grouping only.          |
| **index\_handle**            | Unique identifier of a missing index within a group.                           | N/A                                                                                | No specific range â€” used internally.                     |
| **improvement\_measure**     | Estimated cumulative performance gain if the index is created.                 | Higher is better. Usually > 100,000 is worth considering.                          | Low values (< 10,000) may not justify index creation.    |
| **group\_handle**            | Redundant internal identifier for the group.                                   | N/A                                                                                | Similar to `index_group_handle`.                         |
| **unique\_compiles**         | Number of unique query compilations that identified the index as useful.       | Higher values (e.g., > 100) indicate recurring query patterns.                     | If zero, it's either not used or was cached.             |
| **user\_seeks**              | How many times SQL Server would have used this index for seek operations.      | High numbers (> 1000) are a strong sign to create the index.                       | Zero indicates little or no benefit expected from seeks. |
| **user\_scans**              | How often full scans might have been avoided with this index.                  | Low values are ideal; high values suggest the index could reduce full-table scans. | If > 1000, an index could prevent expensive scans.       |
| **last\_user\_seek**         | Date/time when a query last would have benefited from a seek using this index. | Should be recent (within last 7â€“30 days depending on usage).                       | If very old, the index may no longer be relevant.        |
| **last\_user\_scan**         | Date/time when a query last could have benefited from a scan using this index. | Recent date indicates continued relevance.                                         | If NULL, no scan benefit has occurred.                   |
| **avg\_total\_user\_cost**   | Average cost of queries that would benefit from this index.                    | Higher cost (> 100) means more potential gain.                                     | Very low values (< 10) suggest minimal benefit.          |
| **avg\_user\_impact**        | % improvement expected from this index.                                        | > 70% = high value, 30â€“70% = moderate, < 30% = low value.                          | Low values mean less meaningful improvement.             |
| **system\_seeks**            | How many system processes (like internal maintenance) would use this index.    | Typically low or zero unless used by indexed views/system.                         | Unusually high values may need investigation.            |
| **system\_scans**            | Same as above, but for scan operations.                                        | Generally zero unless internal processes are heavy.                                | Large numbers may point to systemic inefficiencies.      |
| **last\_system\_seek**       | Last time the system wouldâ€™ve used this index for a seek.                      | Recent = relevant, NULL = not used by system.                                      | NULL if not used.                                        |
| **last\_system\_scan**       | Last time the system wouldâ€™ve used this index for a scan.                      | Recent date = potentially useful to internal tasks.                                | NULL = not used by internal system scans.                |
| **avg\_total\_system\_cost** | Cost of internal queries benefiting from the index.                            | Similar rules as `avg_total_user_cost`.                                            | Low = less meaningful impact.                            |
| **avg\_system\_impact**      | % improvement in internal operations.                                          | Same interpretation as `avg_user_impact`.                                          | Low % = less system performance benefit.                 |
| **database\_id**             | ID of the database (links to sys.databases).                                   | Must match the expected database (e.g., 5 = your DB).                              | If unknown, may point to temp or system databases.       |
| **object\_id**               | ID of the table or view (links to sys.objects).                                | Used for mapping to table name via query.                                          | No specific range â€” used for identification only.        |

### ðŸ”Ž Recommendations Based on Value Ranges

| Situation                                                 | Suggested Action                                             |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `improvement_measure` > 1,000,000 and `user_seeks` > 1000 | High-impact index â€” consider creating.                       |
| `avg_user_impact` < 20%                                   | May not justify new index unless usage is frequent.          |
| `user_scans` > 500 but `user_seeks` = 0                   | Consider whether an index could help avoid full table scans. |
| `last_user_seek` > 30 days old                            | May indicate the index is no longer relevant.                |
| High number of suggested indexes with overlapping columns | Consolidate to avoid over-indexing.                          |
